And with Spacemacs you can make your old machine make do incredible things at the press of a button!

But there is much to learn, especially if you are new to both Emacs and Vim, and I could not find a guided tour with short, easily digestible 30 min units to recommend to my friends and colleagues. 

So here is a 30 day challenge, introducing you to the main features of Spacemacs (that is to Emacs, Vim and to cherry on top that is the Spacemacs kit) in 30 short lessons. At the end of this challenge, you will be able to integrate Spacemacs in your workflow without the hassle of a cold turkey approach.

I plan to add one new challenge every day, so this should be done by the end of the month!
